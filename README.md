### Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. They aren't as rich in features as some, but they work for me.

# Programs I use:
- URxvt (Terminal Emulator)
- Vim (Text Editor)
- BSPWM (Tiling Window Manager)

# Setup
You can use stow to configure the files, provided you clone this repo into your home directory.
Then you can run:

`cd stow`
`stow -t ~ [program]`

(Program would be one of the directories in this repo, such as vim or bash)
